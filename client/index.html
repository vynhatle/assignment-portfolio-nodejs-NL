 <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Vy Nguyen Nhat Le (Le), currently a junior majoring in Computer Science student at Lewis University, Illinois, USA. 
  My interests include Web Design and App Development.<br>
 <br>I have a great love for traveling. I think there will be many people with similar interests as me. I often travel with family members. 
  Traveling to new lands helps me to have many different experiences. Traveling is the occasion where I can keep good memories with my family. 
  I hope I will have the opportunity to visit as many US states during my time here. 
  I also enjoy listening to music. However, I don’t have any standards in genre selection, I like to listen to any kind of music as long as it’s good. 
  In my spare time I usually read manga or watch movies or playing games.
